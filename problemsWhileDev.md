1. unable to search post title If I type url parameter in different case format.
    not able to search post If post title contains more than 1 word. ex. my day

=> 
    importing 'lodash' libray, which provides feature for lower casing all chars of the String,
    and removes the - from the url parameter. so I can type my-day in url and Get 'my url' in code.
